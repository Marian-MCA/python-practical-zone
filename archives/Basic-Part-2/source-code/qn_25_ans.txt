Ans: Dictionary and list comprehensions are just another concise way to define dictionaries and lists.

Example of list comprehension is-
x=[i for i in range(5)]

The above code creates a list as below-
	
4
[0,1,2,3,4]

Example of dictionary comprehension is-
	
x=[i : i+2 for i in range(5)]

The above code creates a list as below-
	
[0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 4, 3: 5, 4: 6]
