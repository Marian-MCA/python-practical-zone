The common built in data types in python are-

Numbers– They include integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers. eg. 1, 7.9,3+4i

List– An ordered sequence of items is called a list. The elements of a list may belong to different data types. Eg. [5,’market’,2.4]

Tuple– It is also an ordered sequence of elements. Unlike lists , tuples are immutable, which means they can’t be changed. Eg. (3,’tool’,1)

String– A sequence of characters is called a string. They are declared within single or double quotes. Eg. “Sana”, ‘She is going to the market’, etc.

Set– Sets are a collection of unique items that are not in order. Eg. {7,6,8}

Dictionary– A dictionary stores values in key and value pairs where each value can be accessed through its key. The order of items is not important. Eg. {1:’apple’,2:’mango}

Boolean– There are 2 boolean values- True and False.
